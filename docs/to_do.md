# To Do

- Handling Class Imbalance
- Dealing with Different Sources (Different Distributions)
- Data Augmentation, Resize
- Models
- etc.

## Models
*can be pre-trained, ensemble, and deep learning methods*
- CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, VGGNet, etc.)
- Vision Transformers (Deit, Swin)
- Research Specific (Open up research papers to find transformers made exactly for specific tasks like this)

## Other Imp. Things

-  Evaluation Metrics (_Mean Auc_, F1 Score, ROC-AUC)
-  10 Class Labels (Multi-Class Classification)
